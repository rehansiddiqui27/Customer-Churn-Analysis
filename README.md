I've been exploring churn rates and customer behavior for an online streaming service using a dataset from 𝐊𝐚𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞. Here's what I did step-by-step:

✅ 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 to ensure accuracy and reliability.
⚡ Leveraged 𝐃𝐀𝐗 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐬 in Power BI to calculate the Churn Rate of 𝟐𝟔.𝟓𝟒%.

### 📈 Built an interactive 𝐝𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 for insights into:
- Churn based on 𝐓𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐫𝐞, 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫, 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐬
- How factors like 𝐏𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 influence churn.

## Key Insights:
1️⃣ 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡-𝐭𝐨-𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐬 show the highest churn rates compared to long-term plans.
2️⃣ Customers with 𝐏𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 are churning more often.
3️⃣ Tenure of 𝟎-𝟑 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬 is critical, showing the highest churn peaks.
